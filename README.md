This repository contains the codes for the Facility List Coder (FLC). This tool is based on secondary data, and offers a low-cost, scalable, efficient, and user-friendly way to indirectly identify community nutritional environments. Besides other GIS solutions, FLC combine the two main GIS search-engines that are available (Google Maps and Open Street Maps) to perform a spatial query around a pre-defined zone (e.g. schools) , then information is classified based on the meta-data available for each location based on a comprehensive, multi-language list of key words that allows for the categorization of each facility.
